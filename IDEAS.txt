IDEAS
=====

Ideas for things to include in the library:

- Data structures to hold various 3D object types
  - Indexed triangle mesh
  - Lights
  - The entire scene

- Implementations of additional loaders for 3D file formats:
  - .lwo (LightWave Object format)
  - .max (3D Studio Max file format)
  - .dae (Collada file format)

- Implementations of various acceleration structures:
  - BVH (Already implemented in Ray and Kaleidoscope)
  - Regular grid (Already implemented in Nuke)
  - Octree
  - Kd-tree

- More image formats:
  - EXR (using the OpenEXR libraries)
  - DPX & CIN
  - TIFF (using libtiff)

- Code to find out where a ray hits a scene.

- Use quaternions for rotations.

- Support for mouse gestures.

- Conditional compilation of parts which depend on external libraries.
- Build scripts should check which libraries are installed and build
  accordingly.
