IDEAS
=====

Ideas for things to include in the library:

- Data structures to hold various 3D object types
  - Indexed triangle mesh
  - Lights
  - The entire scene

- 3D file format support via a callback-style interface (as in the OBJViewer).

- Implementations of loaders for 3D file formats:
  - .obj (Wavefront OBJ, already supported in the OBJViewer)
  - .ply (PLY from Stanford University, already supported in the OBJViewer)
  - .lwo (LightWave Object format)
  - .max (3D Studio Max file format)
  - .dae (Collada file format)

- Implementations of various acceleration structures:
  - BVH (Already implemented in Ray and Kaleidoscope)
  - Regular grid (Already implemented in Nuke)
  - Octree
  - Kd-tree

- Code to find out where a ray hits a scene.

- Support for orthographic cameras

- Use quaternions for rotations
