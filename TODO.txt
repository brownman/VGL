TODO
====

- Make the current format-specific image loading functions public.
- Make it possible to register additional image loaders without changing the VGL code.

- Make the loadOBJ and loadPLY functions public.
- Make it possible to register additional geometry loaders without changing the VGL code.
- Add support for LWO files.

- Comment the code properly, in a structured format that Doxygen or something can use.
- Add a build target to generate the docs.

- Use CMake to build the library instead of Make.

- Make sure we're only exporting the public symbols from the library.

- Get rid of the BaseCamera class (or gut it, so that it's better for subclassing).
